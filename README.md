## Abstract
Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs among stakeholders in the real world. 

In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science. 

Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks suffcient understanding of the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism. With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems toward understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

## Method
For this review article, we performed a Scopus [2] search to identify publications related to multistakeholder fairness in tourism from both the tourism management and the computer science domain. Through a preliminary manual search, we compiled a set of suitable search terms to design a query that covers the relevant concepts from both research domains. The final search query includes search terms related to fairness and decision-support in tourism, as well as recommender systems and fairness among multiple stakeholders.

This search query delivered 180 publications on which we performed several post-filtering steps: First, we removed any publications not available in English and those off-topic, which reduced the number of publications from 180 to 80. Next, we investigated these 80 publications in more detail to ensure their relevance to our specific research focus. In this stage, we excluded publications that, although related to the topic itself, did not align with the scope of this study, e.g., studies focusing on marketing strategies or research centered on group recommendation systems. Finally, we distill a set of 44 publications that we include in our study. To foster reproducibility, this repository also includes the results of each individual filtering step in form of .ris-files.
