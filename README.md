# Decision-Support for Multistakeholder Fairness in Tourism: How can Algorithms benefit from Social Science?
Repository for the paper "Decision-Support for Multistakeholder Fairness in Tourism: How can Algorithms benefit from Social Science?" submitted to  Frontiers in Big Data - Recommender Systems (Guiding the Journey: Innovative Recommender Systems for Personalized Tourism, Travel, and Hospitality Experiences) [1].

## Abstract
Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs among stakeholders. 
In this work, we investigate how the social science community approaches multistakeholder fairness in tourism to highlight existing gaps in the design of algorithmic decision-support systems. We identify and summarize works from both, social science and computer science, leveraging a semi-systematic literature review. Our findings suggest that social science focuses on using qualitative methods, studying fairness from a normative and holistic perspective. In contrast, computer science primarily considers fairness through descriptive factors, such as measureable discrimination, and relies heavily on mathematically formalized fairness criteria. With the results of this work, we illustrate the gap between the two approaches and emphasize the need for further collaboration between the computer science and social science communities. We believe such collaboration is essential for enhancing algorithmic decision-support systems towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

## Method
For this review article, we performed a Scopus [2] search to identify publications related to multistakeholder fairness in tourism from both the social science and the computer science domain. Through a preliminary manual search, we compiled a set of suitable search terms to design a query that covers the relevant concepts from both research domains. The final search query includes search terms related to fairness and decision-support in tourism, as well as recommender systems and fairness among multiple stakeholders.

This search query delivered 180 publications on which we performed several post-filtering steps: First, we removed any publications not available in English, those clearly off-topic, and those inaccessible through our institutional or open-access means. This reduced the number of publications from 180 to 68. Next, we investigated the 68 publications in more detail to ensure their relevance to our specific research focus. In this stage, we excluded publications that, although related to the topic itself, did not align with the scope of this study, e.g., studies focusing on marketing strategies or research centered on group recommendation systems. Furthermore, this repository also includes the results of each individual post-filtering step in form of .ris-files.
