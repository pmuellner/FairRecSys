AB  - Destination experiencescape is a multistakeholder marketing concept on the experiential components of the destination environment provided for tourists. However, limited studies have considered conceptualizing experiencescape from a multistakeholder perspective and proposed it at the destination level. This study aims to develop a valid scale to identify the components of destination experiencescape in the context of Hanfu tourism from a multistakeholder perspective. Through a rigid development procedure, a 26-item scale represented by seven dimensions entailing (1) cultural component, (2) social component, (3) sensory component, (4) destination hospitality cultural component, (5) functional component, (6) technological component, and (7) natural component was proven to have acceptable scale reliability and validity. The resultant scale is a practical assessment mechanism for designing a destination experiencescape for Hanfu tourism and a valuable reference for marketing on integrating costume-laden traveling into destinations. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Ecotourism is a form of sustainable tourism that emphasizes environmental conservation while enhancing the welfare of local communities. Promoting ecotourism in Chilika wetland is essential for sustaining its cultural heritage, economic viability, and pristine ecosystem. The primary objective of this research is to propose strategies for the sustainable development of ecotourism in key tourist destinations within Chilika, specifically Mangalajodi, Balugaon, and Barkul. This research employed SWOT-QSPM analysis to assess the internal and external factors influencing the ecotourism sector. The study used qualitative interviews, surveys, observations, and expert insights. The findings indicate that ecotourism has enhanced the socioeconomic well-being of the indigenous community in the vicinity of these three prominent tourist destinations. Those engaged in ecotourism, such as guided tours, boat sailing, handicraft manufacturing, and nature camp services, have diversified their sources of income. Furthermore, multistakeholder participation, the implementation of ICT (Information Communication Technology) to modernize interpretation centers, management of tourism infrastructure, and capacity-building programs are identified as the most effective strategies for Barkul, Mangalajodi, and Balugaon, respectively. The increasing number of tourists can impact the carrying capacity of the wetland, leading to environmental concerns. Therefore, monitoring tools can keep track of the number of visitors and ecological indicators. It will aid the policymakers in making better decisions and modifying strategies as needed with the help of clear information and regular reviews. Local community members also acknowledged that the success of ecotourism ventures necessitates human capital, including technical expertise and skillsets, training facilities, government funding, promotion of art and culture, eco-friendly infrastructure, and, most importantly, a pro-conservation attitude. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - This study examines how participation in the Thessaloniki International Fair (T.I.F.) influences exhibitors’ satisfaction and loyalty toward the host city of Thessaloniki. It investigates factors such as event organization, logistical support, business networking opportunities, and exhibitors’ interactions with local infrastructure and services. Using social exchange theory (S.E.T.) as a framework, this research investigates how positive exchanges, including cultural experiences, local hospitality, and professional interactions at the fair, drive destination loyalty. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews with German exhibitors, to capture comprehensive insights into the factors shaping their perceptions. Results indicate high satisfaction with Thessaloniki’s cultural and culinary offerings, with local hospitality emerging as a significant factor in fostering emotional connections and loyalty intentions. However, transportation and accessibility were identified as areas for improvement, as these logistical issues detract from the overall experience and impose perceived ‘costs’ within the exchange. The findings highlight these factors’ roles in shaping destination loyalty and offer actionable recommendations for improving exhibitor experiences. The findings emphasize the broader implications for urban development, highlighting how trade fairs can serve as catalysts for city branding and infrastructural improvements, thereby strengthening Thessaloniki’s position in the competitive M.I.C.E. tourism sector. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Tourism affects not only the tourism industry but also society and stakeholders such as the environment, local businesses, and residents. Tourism recommender systems (TRS) can be pivotal in promoting sustainable tourism by guiding travelers toward destinations with minimal negative impact. Our paper introduces a composite sustainability indicator for a city trip recommender system based on the users’ starting point and month of travel. This indicator integrates CO2e emissions for different transportation modes and analyses destination popularity and seasonal demand. We quantify city popularity based on user reviews, points of interest, and search trends from Tripadvisor and Google Trends data. To calculate a seasonal demand index, we leverage data from TourMIS and Airbnb. We conducted a user study to explore the fundamental trade-offs in travel decision-making and determine the weights for our proposed indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of this indicator into a TRS, illustrating its ability to deliver sustainable city trip recommendations. This work lays the foundation for future research by integrating sustainability measures and contributing to responsible recommendations by TRS. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This study explores the factors influencing tourist citizenship behavior (TCB) at destinations—voluntary actions by tourists that support the destination's well-being. Grounded in social exchange and equity theories, it examines individual traits (prosocial disposition) and destination factors (perceived justice) as drivers of TCB, along with its effect on tourists' patronage intentions. Two structural equation models were applied to tourist data, revealing that both self-perception and perceived justice significantly impact TCB. Notably, perceived justice plays a critical role, shifting explanatory power from traits like social responsibility and empathy, highlighting fairness perceptions as central to TCB. TCB positively influences the likelihood of destination revisits and recommendations, offering insights for destination managers to foster positive tourist behaviors and long-term relationships through equitable practices. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - A memorable visitor experience is crucial for developing a destination brand and attracting visitors to a heritage destination. Understanding visitors’ sentiments is important to enhance their experiences. To answer the research question: how effectively does Bangladesh manage its heritage attractions as tourism experiences? This research has analyzed heritage visitors’ sentiments based on online reviews datasets collected from TripAdvisor pages of 5 archeological sites in Bangladesh. This paper has identified eight dimensions associated with heritage visitors’ experiences. The findings will help heritage authorities design and implement visitor experience management strategies and deliver memorable visitor experiences. Finally, this paper has discussed practical implications and provided some recommendations to the heritage authorities in developing countries. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - When people hear the catchphrase “casino tourism,” an image of standing around the gaming table is conjured with the adrenaline rush induced when anticipating the next play. This review article aims to enrich our collective knowledge of casino tourism by presenting a synthesis of the development trend and future research in this domain. Using PRISMA protocols to include 468 articles in this area for systematic review, four streams of contemporary casino research emerged, including casino marketing, casino stakeholders, service management, and casino destinations. Findings further highlight four future research agendas catering to a more comprehensive understanding of casino tourism: smart casino marketing and services, multistakeholder welfare, the service–profit chain logic, and destination transformation. Thus our research serves as a foundation for scholars striving to advance the scholarship of casino tourism. It calls for bringing boundary-crossing, collaborative, carryover, and coevolutionary perspectives to understand the casino tourism discourse. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Considering the fairness of group satisfaction in the process of travel route recommendation, A group tourism recommendation methods based on user preference and attraction popularity is proposed, called as GTRM. First, we obtain the photo data containing spatial and temporal information on social network sites. Second, we analyze the user preferences and the popularity of attractions in different seasons to form a scoring basis. Based on this, the weights of the users are adjusted. Finally, in order to obtain higher score tour routes, we aggregate the user preference according to the weights to form the group preferences to select attractions. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can not only improve the group satisfaction with the tourism routes, but also reduces the difference of satisfaction among group members, that is, the recommendation results are fair relatively. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This study addresses the problem of recommending restaurants in emerging tourist destinations, taking into account factors vital in these locations, such as location, safety, price and services. The novel recommendation model is based on the well-known logical scoring of preferences (LSP) methodology. The system considers individual preferences across a hierarchy of criteria. The user can customize the recommender by providing suitability scores and aggregation operators for each criterion. The first contribution is the identification of relevant criteria for the selection of restaurants in emerging destinations and the definition of a new scoring system to manage user preferences regarding types of food. The second contribution of this study is the selection of appropriate conjunctive/disjunctive aggregation operators. The recommender system has been tested in a use case in Riohacha (Colombia), obtaining promising results in a wide range of user profiles. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the behavioral predictors that affect tourists’ intentions to visit silver screen destinations. Design/methodology/approach: The survey questionnaire was composed of multi-item measures, and a total of 432 questionnaires were collected by purposive sampling technique. Participants were asked about sensory stimuli, social stimuli, naturalistic stimuli, cultural stimuli, hospitality culture stimuli, cognitive responses, affective responses and behavior approach, which were evaluated using a seven-point Likert scale. Findings: The authors discovered that cognitive and affective responses positively influence the tourists’ intention toward destinations with film-induced tourism, because tourists highly value unique and refreshing symbolic connotations of silver screen destinations, which are commonly predisposed to nostalgia and poetic on the scene. Originality/value: The originality of this study and the theoretical value of the present research lies with revealing specific relations within the film-induced experienscape constructs that are based on the multistakeholder and multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, this study puts forward constructive suggestions for destination stakeholders in regard to how to market film-induced tourism that uses a multidisciplinary approach that is encompassed by experienscape constructs, which thereby reinforces the film-induced tourists’ experience and their behavior approach. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As the number of visitors to protected areas increases and their objectives become more complex, governing and managing protected area tourism is becoming increasingly challenging. Recent literature reflects a growing trend toward stake-holder involvement, including the private sector, NGOs, and local communities, in managing protected area tourism through co-governance arrangements and multi-stakeholder partnerships. However, research in this area is still relatively new, resulting in a lack of theoretical and conceptual foundations regarding this crucial aspect of park and recreation administration. To address this gap, a scoping literature review was conducted to assess current governance practices and their effectiveness in protected area tourism. The review of published studies focused on two primary categories: 1) constructing and operating multi-stake-holder tourism partnerships and 2) evaluating governance and multi-stakeholder tourism partnerships. The paper emphasizes the significance of partnerships in protected area tourism, outlining the conditions and criteria necessary for their success and sustainability, thereby addressing a gap in existing literature. It in-troduces two frameworks: one aimed at shedding light on the creation and management of partnerships in protected areas, and the other focused on evaluating partnerships. These proposed frameworks offer interpretations of the study's findings, illustrate how the research advances understanding in this field, and lay the groundwork for further theoretical and empirical exploration. They may assist park managers and planners in enhancing the tourism management and governance process by providing systematic guidance for establishing and assessing partnership models in protected areas. © 2024, Sagamore Publishing LLC.

AB  - When a multistakeholder recommender system (MRS) is designed to produce sustainable urban tourism promotion, two conflicting goals are of practical interest: (i) to cut down the number of visitors at popular sites and (ii) to satisfy tourists’ preferences, often biased towards popular sites. By modelling the tourists’ limited knowledge of the visited city — an important but often overlooked detail — we simulate interactions between tourists and an MRS that jointly optimises tourist’s utility and promotes less popular sites. Experiments based on data logs collected in three tourist cities reveal that such an MRS can lift tourist’s utility and at the same time reduce the number of visitors at popular sites, manifesting a so-called positive-sum impact. However, a delicate balance is crucial; under- or over-promotion of unpopular sites in the recommendation lists can be adverse to both destination and tourist’s utility. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The travel, tourism, and hospitality industry is a rapidly evolving sector that contributes to the global economy effectively. Effective business management is crucial for success in this industry, as it requires a delicate balance of customer satisfaction, financial sustainability, and responsible practices. In this chapter, we delve into the key aspects of business management in the tourism industry and explore strategies for achieving sustainable growth and success. This chapter explores a multistakeholder perspective in examining the various facets of business engagement in an inclusive setting. The chapter is iterative, with a focus on the crisis management strategies adopted by the tourism business, to tackle the challenges that stakeholders face in a crisis situation. The study also examines case-lets from the hospitality operators. The chapter primarily endorses business management with coping strategies in a crisis management scenario to equip the stakeholders during disasterprone situations. Towards building a competitive and empowered community, a competency framework is proposed for speedy crisis management responses. The implications indicate the role of destinations, over internal strategies and strategy formulation. Paradoxical dilemmas towards inclusive engagement is clarified with dynamics to understand stakeholder engagement in the leisure industry with strategic and tactical perspectives adopted by a good destination governance. The allied and supplementary tourism industry practitioners in the hospitality sector portray business management and success in business through empowered communities with a tactical and strategic outlook. This indeed can reposition and rebrand tourism in the "New Normal" examined through case lets to address the success of inclusive engagement for community self-sufficiency and empowered teams. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) have evolved from only providing user recommendations to becoming convergence points for multiple stakeholders. This necessitates recognizing the interests of all stakeholders, particularly in the tourism sector, which faces challenges like seasonality and resource constraints. Our stakeholder classification identifies consumers, item providers, platform, and society as key stakeholders, highlighting the complexity of real-world relationships. Fairness in TRS demands a multistakeholder approach, integrating sustainability to address the broader societal impact. While research has focused on fair recommendation systems in tourism, the focus on generating sustainable recommendations remains limited. This demo paper aims to enhance fairness in TRS, mainly focusing on society as a stakeholder. We introduce the Green Destination Recommender (GDR), an application that prioritizes Societal Fairness (S-Fairness) by encouraging environmentally conscious decisions. GDR recommends sustainable tourism destinations based on the user's starting location, travel month, and specific interests. The application promotes ecologically friendly options by recommending less popular yet appealing destinations, considering the emissions from transport to reach the destination and the seasonal demand to balance visitor numbers year-round. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to present the evolution of decent work studies. Findings point to several directions for future research efforts, including conceptualizing decent work and the pandemic’s associated impact. Results will help to guide government authorities to promote decent work by delivering fair income, increasing the stability and security of employment and monitoring employees’ work-life balance. Design/methodology/approach: This review consists of knowledge mapping based on keywords from multidisciplinary studies on decent work and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model on tourism and hospitality studies. First, keyword knowledge mapping was conducted in VOSviewer, resulting in 667 papers. Then, a PRISMA model generated a systematic review of the literature in tourism and hospitality based on 41 papers. Findings: Knowledge mapping revealed six thematic clusters, namely, Labor Rights and Gender Equality, Sustainability and Health, Psychology of Working Theory, Conceptualization of Decent Work, Marginalized Groups and Unemployment and Job Quality. According to the PRISMA model, the conceptual evolution of decent work in tourism and hospitality can be divided into three stages: initial (1999–2008), emerging (2009–2018) and development (2019–present). Research limitations/implications: Based on the findings, further interdisciplinary research into decent work is recommended. Scholars in the tourism and hospitality sector can incorporate other fields of decent work, such as psychology, to broaden the lens of studies to discover the role of meaning and purpose in the workplace and to promote the concept to its fullest extent. Furthermore, employees’ assessments of decent work might help businesses improve human resources management via corporate social responsibility measures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first systematic review of decent work in tourism and hospitality. It shows that this notion is in its infancy, as most studies on the topic thus far have been empirical and descriptive. Nonetheless, most findings contribute to knowledge and practice by clarifying industry employment conditions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the key elements and dynamic formation mechanisms involved in the company identity construction during multicompany identification. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a longitudinal single case study method, selected a representative company as the study case and analyzed the interactive practice of identity construction between the company and its external stakeholders based on the theory of organizational identity and sensemaking. Findings: This study finds that the process of company identity construction for external stakeholders involves six elements. Companies mainly use a highly controlled, equality and interaction model to develop identity for a single stakeholder. Company identity is based on the company’s core identity claims and is formed by gradually integrating and cooperating with the identity claims of different stakeholders. Meeting the self-defining needs of stakeholders is a key driving force behind the evolution of company identity. Practical implications: This study offers practical implications for companies to pursue and construct multicompany identity. For different types of external stakeholders, companies can adopt different identity sensemaking models. To build a new company identity, a company needs to do more on the basis of identity insights to break cognitive constraints and build new identity claim. Companies need to integrate new identity claims with the original identity claims. If different identity claims conflict or are difficult to reconcile, it may damage their original identity claims and companies need to evaluate the trade-offs. Originality/value: This study expands the concept of company identity construction from the individual perspective to organizational identity and contributes to research in relationship marketing. This study identifies the key elements of company identity construction with multistakeholder participation and contributes to theory building in company identity research. The results of this study reveal the company identity construction mechanism for different external stakeholders and the dynamic formation process of multicompany identity. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This Handbook on Food Tourism provides an overview of the past, present, and future of research traditions, perspectives, and concerns about the food tourism phenomenon. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, it contributes to the historical and anthropological understanding of the nexus between food, society, and tourism that underpins the divergent business and marketing efforts in tourism today. Expert contributors from across the globe not only explore the theoretical and conceptual foundations of food tourism research, but also address the significance of the multistakeholder nature of tourism in the context of food tourism development. Chapters present empirical research using quantitative and qualitative methods, conceptual papers and critical literature reviews employing archival research methods and informetric mapping, and analysis of secondary data from social, political, and environmental sources. Rich with information and data about diverse socio-cultural and environmental issues, this Handbook consolidates knowledge on the studies of food tourism from around the world and provides a vision for future research. Covering the breadth of food tourism research, this Handbook will be a fundamental reference work for researchers, academics, and students in tourism management, human geography, social and cultural geography, and business and management. It will similarly appeal to professionals, local authorities, and local food and tourism industries and businesses. © The Editor and Contributors Severally 2024. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dramatic growth of online shopping worldwide in the last few years generated negative consequences for local small retailers who do not adopt information technologies. Furthermore, the e-commerce sector is considered a good opportunity to develop sustainable logistic processes. To reach this goal, the proposed paper presents a mathematical model and a metaheuristic algorithm to solve a multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) distinguished by economic, green, and ethical objective functions. The proposed algorithm is a multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) that is implemented in a software architecture and validated with real-world instances that differ for the product type delivered and the geographic distribution of customers. The main result of each test is a tri-dimensional Pareto front, i.e., a decision-support system for practitioners in selecting the best solution according to their needs. From these fronts, it can be observed that if the economic and environmental performances slightly deteriorate by 1.6% and 4.5%, respectively, the social one improves by 19.4%. Furthermore, the developed MOSA shows that the environmental and social objective functions depend on the product dimensions and the geographic distribution of customers. Regarding the former aspect, this paper reports that, counter-intuitively, the metabolic energy consumption per driver decreases with bigger products because the number of necessary vehicles (and drivers) increases, and, thus, the workload is divided among more employees. Regarding the geographic distribution, this manuscript illustrates that, despite similar traveled distances, highly variable altitudes cause more carbon emissions compared to flat distributions. Finally, this contribution shows that delivering small goods decreases the distance that vehicles travel empty by 59%, with a consequent cost reduction of 16%. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to highlight the importance of developing academic research in tourism and hospitality management into a more responsible approach, applying a multistakeholder model. This multistakeholder approach forces the tourist community to be considered when identifying the gaps and impacts of academic research. Design/methodology/approach: This study suggests action research as one of the appropriate methodological approaches for conducting responsible research, as action research allows challenges to be overcome through the interaction of researchers and stakeholders. Principles of responsible research are indicated and exemplar studies that use action research are described. Findings: Proposals and recommendations for responsible research are identified, such as demand-driven research, action research as a methodological approach and a way to address societal challenges, and the importance of considering the research ecosystem. In addition, some advantages (funding, reputation and legitimacy) and barriers (resources and publication) of responsible research are explained. Practical implications: Practical implications are described. Conducting responsible research is oriented toward identifying real practical implications proposed and validated by the tourist community instead of being proposed solely by the researchers. Social implications: This paper emphasizes the need to work together with the tourist community and their stakeholders to enhance the real societal impact of academic research in tourism and hospitality management. Originality/value: The authors would like to raise a self-critical debate for the future enrichment of research in the tourism industry. Research in this industry can contribute to solving significant societal problems. Responsible research can help scholars to be part of the solution to these challenges, working together with different tourism stakeholders. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In order to achieve a healthy two sided marketplace, a recommender system balancing the user and the item interests must be deployed. One of the challenges for such a system is to give new items a fair chance to compete against an existing supply. In the context of an online travel agency, this challenge arises not only from the classical cold start problem in recommender systems but also from the customer’s reluctance to book new properties due to high uncertainty about their quality, which is often alleviated by past customer reviews. In this paper, we share how a multi-funnel recommender system was developed to address this specific challenge and how the effect of such intervention can be measured on both the customers and the supply. Along with the main recommender delivering a personalized ranking maximizing customers conversion, a second funnel focusing on only cold properties can be used to generate an alternative optimistic ranking. Then these two rankings are merged in a way to balance between short term conversion rate and long term metrics assessing the supply health and properties performance. We show this intervention has different effects when segmenting both customers and properties and suggest future directions given these observations. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This study examines the issues of the review process and proposes some reform strategies. In the attempts to reform the system or promote further research, stakeholders are essential in modifying the system, as the decisions of editors, reviewers, and authors can significantly impact the procedure and results. Using grounded theory, the researchers provide a five-theme and 11-subtheme framework for fair peer review. This study investigates several stages of the review and provides recommendations for editors, reviewers, and authors to improve fairness and transparency. The findings’ managerial implications are also highlighted. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rationale: For a developing economy like India, the role of tourism industry is imperative in terms of mobilization of foreign currency into the economy and also to ensure the flow of money into the different economic processes which ultimately ensures several socioeconomic benefits. Principal benefits which are directly associated with the tourism industry are employment, income and foreign exchange, allied (medical, medical tourism; rural, rural tourism; agriculture, rural tourism; sports, sports tourism; handicrafts; infrastructure or real estate; banking and financial services; travel and transport; etc.) sectors’ development, etc. As the products and services associated with the tourism are mostly intangible and heterogeneous as they are service specific or oriented, it is always needed to be prone to tourist needs. In India, image of Rajasthan in tourism sector is incomparable due to its rich historical, cultural, and environmental heritage which get frilled and enriched through its incredible fairs, festivals, temples, and other handicrafts. Hadoti region in Rajasthan carries all the characteristics with the immense potential for tourism nourished through natural splendor, bravura forts, diverse flora and fauna, glorified historical contribution, palaces, festivals, rivers, water sports, biodiversity, thermal springs, hanging bridge, parks, advantage of education city, and many more other attractions. Hence, the region is not explored to be developed as the preferable tourist destination and that is why the tourist activities in their region are low. So it is required to empirically assess hoteliers, travel agents, and tour operators’ opinion for the lacunas and challenges in the development of tourism in Hadoti region of Rajasthan. Methodology: With the basic ideology of exploring the hoteliers, travel agents and tour operators’ opinion for the lacunas, and challenges in the development of tourism in Hadoti region of Rajasthan, a well-structured questionnaire was arrayed among the aforementioned target group respondents of Hadoti region (Baran, Bundi, Jhalawar, and Kota). In order to approach the respondents for their responses, strata and convenience sampling methods were followed successively. Further, the encoded dataset was statistically examined through different statistical tests to measure the significance or insignificance of established hypotheses. Conclusion: It was noticed that preservation of environment, cultural heritage, monuments, forts, ecology, local culture, and biological diversity is a very challenging aspect in Hadoti region. Perceptions and perspectives of the tourism stakeholders for the effect of challenges on tourism have close and significant relationship with the sociocultural, geopolitical, and technoenvironmental challenges and type of services (perpetual and seasonal service provider) they are associated with, which drives their perspective imperatively. It is also noticed that in Hadoti region (Kota, Bundi, Jhalawar, and Baran), sociocultural, geopolitical, and technoenvironmental challenges are approximately identical because the respondents carry the insignificant difference in their perspective about the effect of challenges in the overall prosperity of tourism in the region. Further, recommendation for the PPP for renovation or restoration heritage places, monuments, temples, and miniatures may also ensure beautification of the region. Government should also promote the schemes for development of traditional arts, handicraft, and other small-scale traditional heritage activities. It was also pointed by the respondents that the government has started taking the initiative for the tourism development in Hadoti region through integrating the Hadoti circuit with other tourist circuits of the state and country. Hadoti region has the full potential to be developed as the favorite tourist destination, if certain lacunas and challenges were managed by the localities and government in a satisfactory manner. Practical Contribution: Favorable tourism processes and practices bring multidimensional growth and prosperity followed with the socioeconomic advantages to region, state, and country through employment opportunities, international linkages, removal of regional disparities, flow of national and foreign currencies, restoration of heritages, developing the extinct cultural heritage and handicrafts, etc. So the study would be helpful to find the basic lacunas and challenges in the development of tourism in Hadoti region of Rajasthan which is to be taken into consideration by the local and state administration (DoT, RTDC, and semigovernment agencies) for improving the overall scenario of tourism in Hadoti. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.

It underscores the imperative of economic diversification for tourism-centric economies, especially in light of vulnerabilities exposed by global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Method/Design/Approach: Employing a qualitative research design, the study utilizes in-depth interviews, focus groups, and participatory research methods with local entrepreneurs and stakeholders. This approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the experiences, strategies, and perceptions of those directly involved in Pattaya's SMEs and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Results and Conclusion: The research findings highlight a significant trend towards digital innovation and a reorientation towards local markets among Pattaya's SMEs. It uncovers the necessity for substantial investments in technology and digital infrastructure to enhance economic resilience and adaptability. Furthermore, the study accentuates the pivotal role of government in fostering an enabling environment through regulatory reforms, financial incentives, and infrastructure enhancements. The importance of educational initiatives in nurturing entrepreneurial skills and the critical involvement of the private sector and international organizations in supporting economic diversification efforts are also detailed. The conclusion posits that a collaborative, multistakeholder approach is vital for the sustainable economic development of Pattaya, moving beyond its traditional tourism-focused model. Originality/Value: This study contributes original insights into the challenges and opportunities for economic diversification in tourism-dependent economies, with a particular focus on Pattaya, Thailand. It offers valuable practical recommendations for SMEs, policymakers, and other stakeholders.

AB  - The stakeholder responsible behavior (SRB) scale is a recently developed measurement scale designed to assess individuals’ responsible behavior. The present study seeks to conceptualize and validate the SRB scale. A number of tourism stakeholders are now working together to develop sustainable tourism practices at the destination. Furthermore, only a few studies have examined stakeholder responsibilities in tourism. Therefore, this study attempts to conceptualize stakeholder responsible behavior in tourism from a multistakeholder perspective using the triple bottom line (TBL) theory. In order to assess the responsible behavior of stakeholders in a comprehensive manner, we developed a measurement scale. In the study, responses were collected from two stakeholder groups, residents and tourists. Following that, statistical techniques were used to evaluate the scale’s reliability and validity. According to the results, assessing the behavior of stakeholders in three dimensions is vital for achieving sustainability status within destinations. Based on the scale validated by this study, destination management organizations (DMOs) will be able to bring multiple stakeholders together to evaluate underlying sustainability issues and develop solutions.

AB  - Through a multistakeholder partnership, this research aims to catalyze the development of a blue economy corridor (BEC) through communitybased asset mapping in the eastern portion of the Tar-Pamlico River Basin in North Carolina, a geographic area predominated by physically and culturally rural landscapes. Underpinned by appreciative inquiry, this project aims to counter a deficit model of community development in this portion of eastern North Carolina by increasing awareness of quality of life assets that communities currently possess and may leverage for sustainable economic, environmental, and social development through their inclusion in a digital interactive map freely available to the public. © 2024 by the University of Georgia.

AB  - This paper investigates the implications of value chain models in mainstream ecotourism as a potential ecosystem-based adaptation in developing country contexts via three case studies across Vietnam, including Lai Chau, Lam Dong and Dong Thap. While the models of the two former two are similar, Dong Thap employs a special unit known as Destination Management Unit, or DMO, to help manage the operations of ecotourism. In this study, a mixed method approach was applied, including both in-depth group discussions and questionnaire-based surveys collecting inputs from tourists and the local tourism business households. For data analysis, we employed two multivariate analysis methods, including multi correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. From a tourist’s perspective, DMO provides insurance for services and eliminates intermediate fees. It creates trust in services, improving overall satisfaction, which is a key element for tourist retention. Furthermore, DMO can ensure fair competition, producing a sustainable environment for ecotourism development in the area. However, from business households’ perspectives, the effectiveness of the DMO is still subpar. In contrast, in the case of Lai Chau, we found positive support from the government for tourism activities. The role of the government in the promotion of tourism in Lai Chau can be seen through marketing efforts and the organization of publicity events. In essence, even without the establishment of a dedicated management unit, the management and development of ecotourism can be streamlined should there be effective participation from the government. The findings herewith present an inclusive strategy or instruction for the application of the DMO in a particular area. Empirical results from Lai Chau and Dong Thap point that application without localization is unfeasible. For that matter, localization is key for its application, which requires instruction from the government. Secondly, the improvement of the resource may enhance the experience of the tourists and possibly attract higher travel. The resources mentioned included tangible resources such as infrastructure, accommodation, information access and intangible resources such as human resources and local identity. Lastly, we recommend that DMO should present as the moderator in the value chain of ecotourism which promotes the healthy connection among the members in the ecotourism value chain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Tourism is the primary source of income for many countries, particularly developing ones. However, due to the impact of the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic, the tourism sector has been significantly affected. This study aims to identify factors that influence motivation and travel frequency. Two scenarios were compared: during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19. The questionnaire was developed based on the Health Belief model. The data collection process involved distributing a comprehensive questionnaire throughout Thailand, with the aim of achieving a fair and balanced representation of respondents from six distinct regions: northern, central, eastern, western, north-eastern, and southern. The study included a total of 2100 participants. Twenty hypotheses were formulated to analyze the relationship between the latent constructs. Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling were utilized to analyze the data from the questionnaires. The results from SEM found that the model was consistent with the empirical data. The model of the during COVID-19 pandemic had three supported hypotheses, namely H2d, H5d, and H9d, which were the correlation between tourism motivation and perceived severity, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, respectively. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, seven hypotheses, including H1p, H2p, H3p, H4p, H5p, H9p, and H10p, supported the correlation between intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and frequency. The support for H10p indicated that stimulated motivation could lead to behavioral changes and increase people’s travel frequency. This study proposes policy recommendations and public relations guidelines to encourage more frequent travel. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Recommender Systems (RS) are widely used in various domains, including travel and tourism, to provide personalized recommendations for accommodations, activities, and destinations. However, the evaluation of RS has traditionally focused on satisfying the needs of end users, item providers, or the recommendation platform itself without considering the impact on society. Sustainable tourism practices are becoming increasingly important, and a Tourism Recommendation System (TRS) can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability by suggesting sustainable activities and less popular destinations to users. In this study, we explore the effect of integrating sustainable recommendations into TRS to ensure fairness for society. We conduct a user study utilizing synthetic recommendations to assess user perceptions of sustainable options versus unsustainable options. Our contributions include insights into effective strategies for incorporating sustainable items in recommendations, understanding user reactions to sustainable alternatives, and identifying helpful recommendation elements for users in their decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that including sustainable options in recommendations can encourage tourists to visit sustainable and less popular areas and help address issues such as overtourism and undertourism in the travel and tourism industry. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - In the travel industry, Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) are gaining popularity as they simplify trip planning for travelers by offering personalized recommendations for accommodations, activities, destinations, and more.Ensuring fairness in TRS involves considering the needs and viewpoints of different stakeholders, including consumers, item providers, the platform, and society.Although previous research has focused on fairness in TRS from a multistakeholder perspective, little attention has been given to generating sustainable recommendations.This doctoral thesis introduces the concept of Societal Fairness (S-Fairness) to consider the impact of tourism on non-participating stakeholders (society) such as residents, who may be affected by tourism issues such as increased housing prices, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion.The objective of this research is to contribute to the field of TRS by (1) modeling sustainability for societal fairness, (2) developing a fair multistakeholder TRS that balances sustainability concerns with other stakeholders while minimizing trade-offs, and (3) evaluating the approach through user studies and offline dataset evaluation to ensure user acceptance of recommendations. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Festivals and fairs abound throughout India. More festivals are observed in this nation than everywhere else in the globe. Social and cultural festivals and fairs have become a tool for promoting regional economies, extending the tourist season, and developing the tourism industry. The effects of these fairs and festivals matter for the local economy as well as the tourism industry. The culture, traditions, and festivals provide an explanation of the "way of life of a place" and aid in our understanding of a certain locale. To discover more about the customs and traditions of the host town, many tourists go to attend a variety of festivals. The chapter has therefore concentrated on different regional fairs and festivals of Rajasthan that have not yet been explored with the intention of enhancing the local economy, and such chances occasionally go unused. The recommendation would therefore be to invest in festival development and community involvement while providing tourists with distinctive experiences. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in homestays could improve the tourist experience and operational efficiency. This article proposes a comprehensive conceptual framework for AI in homestays, encompassing visitor experience enhancement, personalized suggestions, predictive analytics, inventory management, maintenance scheduling, and data analytics. AI algorithms allow homestay owners to make personalized recommendations for activities, local sights, and meals. AI-powered home automation systems let guests customize lighting, temperature, and entertainment. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants help visitors with questions and requests. Predictive analytics models help operators optimize pricing, estimate demand, and allocate resources, improving revenue management and operational efficiency. AI-based inventory management systems optimize inventory levels, reduce waste, and ensure supplies. Proactive maintenance using AI lowers downtime and enhances the visitor experience. AI-enabled data analytics systems measure occupancy rates, revenue, and visitor satisfaction in real time for informed decision-making and ongoing development. AI in homestays must handle ethical issues including openness, fairness, and accountability, as well as privacy and data security. Cost, technological knowledge, and user approval are other challenges. This article concludes that AI technology in homestays can improve tourist experiences and operational efficiency. Future research should address ethical, privacy, and implementation issues to fully fulfill AI's transformational potential in homestays. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study proposes an AI-based paradigm for travel review analysis. Travel reviews influence customer choices and the tourist business. The framework includes data collection and preprocessing, sentiment analysis, feature extraction and topic modeling, deep learning, and insight production. Data collection and preparation provide diversified, high-quality trip review data for analysis. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining classify reviews to determine travelers happiness. Feature extraction and topic modeling reveal traveler preferences and interests by extracting keywords, topics, and features from reviews. Deep learning methods like CNN and LSTM networks capture complicated travel review structures and dependencies, improving sentiment analysis and opinion mining. These methods help contextualize passengers feelings and preferences throughout time. The proposed approach yields travel industry-wide information. They assist in data-driven decision-making, personalized suggestions, destination marketing and management strategies, service quality, market research and competitive analysis, and product creation. AI travel review analysis presents obstacles and considerations. These include data quality and availability, privacy and ethical considerations, bias mitigation and fairness, interpretability and explainability, technical skills and resources, user acceptability and adoption, and continual learning. By adopting the proposed conceptual framework and overcoming the obstacles, travel companies can gain deeper insights from travel reviews, improve customer experiences, and make informed decisions to stay competitive in the dynamic and growing travel market.

AB  - The Mountain Partnership is the only United Nations voluntary alliance of partners dedicated to improving the livelihoods of mountain people and protecting the role of mountains in providing essential ecosystem goods and services to the planet. It thrives on a global, diverse and inclusive constituency, comprising governments, intergovernmental organizations, civil society, and private sector. It currently counts over 500 members. As a multistakeholder horizontal alliance, it operates on different levels—global, regional, and local—and plays a prominent role in relevant global and regional fora and advocacy events. Its communication and advocacy activities are aimed at promoting investments as well as to the prioritization of mountains on member countries’ national agendas. The Mountain Partnership furthermore contributes to monitoring mountain activities through the collection and sharing of knowledge, disseminating best practices, and brokering initiatives among members. Through its capacity development activities, it builds expertise and creates expanding networks of practitioners for the sustainable management of mountains. Projects and initiatives in the field are aimed at empowering mountain farmers in the marketing of local quality products and sustainable tourism, improving the value chains of products that are produced and processed in mountains, and enhancing the capacities of institutions and communities on the risk-based watershed management approach for forest and land use management to improve local populations’ livelihoods. The Mountain Partnership plays a leading role in improving and sustaining healthy environments in the world’s mountain regions and safeguarding the livelihoods of mountain people so that they are fully included in the implementation of the United Nations agendas, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the UN Food Systems Summit 2021, and the Five Years of Action for the Development of Mountain Regions 2023–2027, so that they are not left behind. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Major online platforms today are multi-stakeholder in nature and they cater to the interests of various stakeholders. Examples include e-commerce platforms with sellers of goods and services and buyers who pay for them, hotel booking platforms with hosts and guests, media-streaming platforms artists or content creators and viewers, and many more. The focus here is on the information access services (like search and recommendation) deployed on these platforms. While traditionally these services were designed in consumer-centric ways, they are found to be unfair to providers. Since the providers depend on these platforms for their livelihood, fairness for providers is an important and necessary design element in many scenarios. This chapter summarizes the domain and discusses various prior works on provider fairness in such multi-stakeholder platforms after a brief review of major works on algorithmic fairness in machine learning. Many recent works show that provider fairness can cause loss of utility and unfairness for consumers. Following this, a number of works have proposed fairness notions for both providers and consumers in different settings, and studied multi-stakeholder fairness to balance various fairness and utility goals or constraints. This chapter reviews some major works on multi-stakeholder fairness in the following three aspects: the problem setting, fairness notions, and proposed approaches. It also discusses how most of the works on multi-stakeholder fairness have considered settings with only two stakeholders, gives some examples on other platforms with more than two stakeholders, and how they are fundamentally different in terms of the utility structure for the stakeholders. © The Institution of Engineers (India) 2023.

AB  - Development planning documents are very important for the success of village development. However, villages often face challenges in planning due to the large number of activities that must be accommodated, limited funds, and the inability to determine activity priorities. This study aims to design a medium-term development plan in Ponggok Village, Polanharjo District, Klaten Regency, Central Java, using the AHP and Linear Regression methods. The AHP method is used to prioritize activities based on calculated weights and values. Meanwhile, the Linear Regression model is used to predict village income and rationalize activities that will be realized each year. Based on this study, the most important criteria for determining priority activities are compatibility with the vision and mission of the village, sustainability, benefit, self-management, and fairness. The development of human resources (MSME training and scholarship programs) and infrastructure development to support tourism activities are the most prioritized activities (asphalt roads, construction of tourism facilities, and performing arts). This study concludes that the AHP and Linear Regression methods can help make decisions for village development planning in an effective, efficient, and on-target manner. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Group recommendations are becoming prominent, since there are several applications in which users form groups for activities (e.g., tourism, restaurants, movies). SQUIRREL is a framework for sequential group recommendations, i.e., it may be used by a group in several rounds, providing a different recommendation in each round. The goal is that, after some rounds, all group members will be fairly satisfied with the recommendations, even if, individually, some users may not be very satisfied in every round. In this paper, we present SQUIRREL Movies, an implementation of SQUIRREL in the movies domain. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The prior research on tourist route design for heterogeneous groups primarily focused on total tourist preferences and individual fairness. In this study, we present an innovative approach by incorporating safety criteria into the optimal tourist route, an aspect that has been previously overlooked. Ensuring tourist safety during travel and attractions is of utmost importance for creating a secure and enjoyable experience. Our proposed safety-focused multi-objective tourist trip design, coupled with the modified artificial multiple-intelligence system, underwent testing in a case study involving 50 attractions and 44 tourist groups (comprising a total of 140 members). The computational results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by 16.16% to 36.26%, effectively reducing total traveling and attraction visiting risk by 26.1% compared to conventional techniques proposed in the literature. Moreover, our approach enhances the total preferences and tourist fairness by 5.83% and 25.57%, respectively. © 2023 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.

AB  - Purpose: The paper presents empirical evidence of sustainable practices adopted by rural tourism stakeholders. It explores the concept and meaning of sustainable practices and what motivates rural tourism stakeholders to adopt sustainable tourism practices as well as recommendations to enhance sustainable rural tourism practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes an exploratory qualitative research project designed to investigate sustainable tourism practices of the rural tourism stakeholders. An inductive approach was adopted to address the research objectives. Specifically, this paper focuses on individuals' subjectivity and understanding of sustainable tourism practices in terms of meaning, motivations, and areas of improvement. The respondents' opinions were collected through semi-structured interviews. A total of 29 rural tourism operators participated in the data collection from the two rural tourism associations in Sabah, Malaysia. The data collection was held at Kota Marudu and Kuala Penyu from April to May 2022. Findings: The findings revealed that sustainable tourism practices relate to conservation and preservation, economic benefits, collaboration and protection, environmental impact, future growth, awareness, knowledge, and improvement. Interestingly, the meaning of sustainable tourism practices is strongly connected to the term "fairness," to competitive products and quality attractions, and to meeting tourists' needs. This implies the meaning of sustainable tourism practices is not limited to economic, environmental, and sociocultural impacts; it also relates to quality tourism products and the needs of tourists. Key drivers for sustainability practices include economic, social, environmental, and government support. Relevant approaches for improving sustainable rural tourism practices include greater participation and collaboration among rural tourism operators, conservation and preservation, destination uniqueness, long-term growth, and 3Rs practices (reduce, reuse, and recycle). Research limitations/implications: Findings implicate sustainable rural tourism destination management and the rural tourism stakeholders to adopt and enhance the sustainability of the rural sites and destination. It also extends the scope of existing literature on the meaning, motivation and sustainability practices of rural tourist destinations. Originality/value: This study focuses on the importance of sustainability in rural tourism in Sabah, Malaysia, an area on which limited empirical research has been done. The study provides an in-depth understanding of the meaning and drivers of sustainable practices from the rural tourism operators' perspectives. Additionally, it proposes sound strategies for sustainable rural tourism practices. Such practices and development are attributed to an individual's understanding of the concept of and motives for adopting sustainable development practices, government support, and core infrastructure. Finally, this study offers practical implications for sustainable development of rural tourism. © 2023 People and Global Business Association.

AB  - The growing use of Recommender Systems (RS) across various industries, including e-commerce, social media, news, travel, and tourism, has prompted researchers to examine these systems for any biases or fairness concerns. Fairness in RS is a multi-faceted concept ensuring fair outcomes for all stakeholders involved in the recommendation process, and its definition can vary based on the context and domain. This paper highlights the importance of evaluating RS from multiple stakeholders' perspectives, specifically focusing on Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS). Stakeholders in TRS are categorized based on their main fairness criteria, and the paper reviews state-of-the-art research on TRS fairness from various viewpoints. It also outlines the challenges, potential solutions, and research gaps in developing fair TRS. The paper concludes that designing fair TRS is a multi-dimensional process that requires consideration not only of the other stakeholders but also of the environmental impact and effects of overtourism and undertourism.

AB  - In this work, we employ various preference aggregation mechanisms from the social choice literature alongside with a multiwinner voting rule, namely the Reweighted Approval Voting (RAV), to the group recommendations problem. In more detail, we equip with such mechanisms a Bayesian recommender system for the tourism domain, allowing for the effective aggregation of elicited group members’ preferences while promoting fairness in the group recommendations. We conduct a systematic experimental evaluation of our approach by applying it on a real-world dataset. Our results clearly demonstrate that the use of multiwinner mechanisms allows for fair group recommendations with respect to the well-known m-proportionality and m-envy-freeness metrics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is an essential service to location-based social networks (LBSNs), benefiting both users providing them the chance to explore new locations and businesses by discovering new potential customers. These systems learn the preferences of users and their mobility patterns to generate relevant POI recommendations. Previous studies have shown that incorporating contextual information such as geographical, temporal, social, and categorical substantially improves the quality of POI recommendations. However, fewer works have studied in-depth the multi-aspect benefits of context fusion on POI recommendation, in particular on beyond-accuracy, fairness, and interpretability of recommendations. In this work, we propose a linear regression-based fusion of POI contexts that effectively finds the best combination of contexts for each (i) user, or (ii) group of users from their historical interactions. The results of large-scale experiments on two popular datasets Gowalla and Yelp reveal several interesting findings. First, the proposed approach does not present significant loss in accuracy and unfairness of popularity bias as with classical collaborative baselines, and yet improves the beyond-accuracy of recommendation compared with existing context-aware (CA) approaches using heuristic context fusions; for instance, the proposed approach improves the accuracy and beyond-accuracy compare to best baseline model by 25% and 30%, respectively. Second, our proposed approach is interpretable, allowing to explain to the user why she has been recommended specific POIs, based on the learned context weights from user past check-ins; for example, if you are in Rome and our method recommends you a historical place like ‘Colosseum’, it can also provide an explanation why this item is recommended to you based on your personal preference on context (e.g., you were recommended to visit ‘Colosseum’ because in the past your visited historical places). Third, by analyzing the fairness of recommendation with respect to users (based on their activity levels) and items (based on the popularity of items), we found that a model which is recommend fairly on one dataset can recommend unfair on another dataset. Overall, our study suggests that appropriate context fusion is an essential element of an accurate, fair, and transparent POI recommendation system. We highlight that while we have tested the efficacy of our context-fusion methods on two popular CA recommendation models in the POI domain, namely GeoSoCa and LORE, our system can be flexibly utilized to extend the capability of other CA algorithms. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Recommending appropriate travel destinations to consumers based on contextual information such as their check-in time and location is a primary objective of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. However, the issue of contextual bias (i.e., how much consumers prefer one situation over another) has received little attention from the research community. This paper examines the effect of temporal bias, defined as the difference between users' check-in hours, leisure vs. work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation algorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and geographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution, noting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI recommendation, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware models to the temporal bias contained in users' check-in activities on two POI datasets, namely Gowalla and Yelp. The findings show that the examined context-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another based on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users have the same amount of interactions. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to understand the impact of smart working on employees’ quality of life. The service-dominant logic indicates that key actors, including employees, are resource integrators. This empirical study contributes to the current knowledge of transformative service by expounding on smart working practices and their relationship with self-efficacy and, ultimately, quality of life of employees. Design/methodology/approach: This study contends that smart working enhances employees’ self-efficacy. The current research uses conservation of resources (COR) theory as a basis in hypothesizing that self-efficacy serves as a key resource, which can stimulate workplace creativity, job satisfaction and quality of life. An onsite survey is conducted among employees who have been involved in smart working in the travel agency context. Findings: Smart working has a positive effect on self-efficacy, which positively influences workplace creativity, job satisfaction and quality of life. Workplace creativity enhances job satisfaction but does not influence quality of life. Job satisfaction boosts quality of life, which is important to tourism services and their employees amid various crises. Research limitations/implications: Consistent with COR theory, the immediate recommendation to managers is to invest in smart working, which can lead to employees’ creativity, job satisfaction and quality of life. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this empirical study is the first to assess the viability of smart working in the travel agency context. Smart working offers positive outcomes, such as convenience for employees to work independently, improving workplace creativity, job satisfaction and quality of life. Travel agencies are mainly categorized as small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the future, SMEs may also introduce smart working that can eventually become their competitive advantage to retain talented employees. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The present study explores thermal tourism destination competitiveness from the stakeholder viewpoint, aiming to offer guidelines to decision makers for making sustainable decisions. Qualitative research was conducted to collect data through semistructured interviews and from secondary sources. The empirical framework is set in the city of Ourense, an outstanding reference for thermal tourism in Spain. The results show that thermal destination competitiveness is a complex three-dimensional concept due to the existence of interactions between its determining factors. The results emphasize that when strategies to improve the competitiveness of thermal destinations are designed, one must consider not only the greater or lesser importance of the determinants of competitiveness but also the interactions between them and their heterogeneous influences on each dimension of thermal destination competitiveness. Moreover, destinations’ characteristics and positions within the tourism area life cycle condition the relevance of such factors. © 2022, Asociacion Espanola de Expertos Cientificos en Turismo.

AB  - Many online platforms today (such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn, and AirBnB) can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of goods and services. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms have focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our investigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these services may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which may adversely impact their well-being. However, a pure producer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more people are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to ensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a fair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness guarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed FairRec algorithm guarantees Maxi-Min Share of exposure for the producers, and Envy-Free up to One Item fairness for the customers. Extensive evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of FairRec in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in overall recommendation quality. Finally, we present a modification of FairRec (named as FairRecPlus) that at the cost of additional computation time, improves the recommendation performance for the customers, while maintaining the same fairness guarantees. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Group recommender systems (GRSs) in most e-commerce and tourism applications like Booking. com, Traveloka.com, Amazon, etc. have risen in recent years. One of the most concerning problems in GRSs is to guarantee the fairness between users in a group called the consensus-driven group recommender system. This paper proposes a new flexible alternative that embeds a fuzzy measure to aggregation operators of consensus process to improve fairness of group recommendation and deals with group member interaction. Choquet integral is used to build a fuzzy measure based on group member interactions and to seek a better fairness recommendation. The empirical results on the benchmark datasets show the incremental advances of the proposal for dealing with group member interactions and the issue of fairness in consensus-driven GRS. © 2022 IGI Global.

AB  - The chapter provides an overview of the literature investigating the sharing economy in tourism with the aim to identify what we already know and what we should further investigate about two major issues: (1) the multidimensionality of the sharing economy phenomenon and its impacts on tourism and its stakeholders and (2) the variety of the actors and the major issues pertaining their involvement in the sharing economy. By adopting an ecosystem approach, this chapter aims to contribute to the literature by providing a holistic multistakeholder, multidimensional, and multidisciplinary perspective of how we (should) understand and research the sharing economy in tourism. To achieve this, the chapter begins by clarifying the concept of the sharing economy and its overlaps with other related concepts such as gig, platform, collaborative, and peer-to-peer economy. This section concludes by developing a figure visualizing the four major sharing economy stakeholders, namely, platform; provider (i.e., micro-entrepreneurs, company, tourism gig worker) which includes the subeconomies of secondary entrepreneurs; seeker (e.g., tourist, seeker of resources); and environment/destination. The chapter continues by individual sections that each one discusses the research themes and gaps pertaining to each sharing actor and by concluding with ideas for future research. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - We focus on the goal of designing recommender systems (RSs) for sustainable tourism itinerary planning. In particular, we focus on the problem of rearranging tourist flows in order to protect popular destinations from overcrowding, as well as to stimulate the development of less mature destinations by distributing tourists throughout the territory. This topic is quite new in the recommendation literature, although it is well known in the tourism literature. We aim to transfer concepts from the field of tourism to the field of RSs in order to improve tourism development. Our approach is to take into account the goals of all the active stakeholders, and not to focus solely on tourists. Here, we propose a multistakeholder utility model for travel itinerary optimisation. We experimentally show that it is possible to mitigate the aforementioned environmental issues with a slight decrease in user satisfaction utility. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Coffee was used as a symbiosis key value attracting tourists in community-based tourism at Pang Khon village, Chiang Rai, Thailand. The mixed method was applied. The data collected by administering in-depth interview, focus group, participatory rural appraisal, and participatory observation amongst the public, private and community for qualitative data collection. Whereas, the questionnaires were employed for quantitative data collection. The structural equation modelling was applied to compliment and foster the qualitative data. The sample group composes of public entity including local government, Tourism Authority of Thailand Chiang Rai officers, officers from ministry of tourism and sport of Thailand [MOT's officers], Pang Khon villagers, restaurant and private travel agencies, hoteliers, local transport providers, and tourists. The economic, education, emotion, research, and experience values were discovered. To assess coffee symbiosis value to community-based tourism. The mixed method research was employed by using in-depth interview, focus group, participatory rural appraisal, participatory for qualitative approach. The quantitative approach was conducted by using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results found coffee create economic, education, emotion, research, and experience values to community-based tourism. The author would recommend the policy makers highlighting on innovation of new products and services. The promotion should emphasize on the source of coffee plantation in community. That is taste of fresh coffee from its origin. However, the fair distribution of revenue to local residents shall be well-planned for dynamic cooperation and improvement of community economic. © 2022 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

AB  - Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems provide personalized recommendations to users and help businesses attract potential customers. Despite their success, recent studies suggest that highly data-driven recommendations could be impacted by data biases, resulting in unfair outcomes for different stakeholders, mainly consumers (users) and providers (items). Most existing fairness-related research works in recommender systems treat user fairness and item fairness issues individually, disregarding that RS work in a two-sided marketplace. This paper studies the interplay between (i) the unfairness of active users, (ii) the unfairness of popular items, and (iii) the accuracy (personalization) of recommendation as three angles of our study triangle. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged levels to measure user fairness based on their activity level. For item fairness, we divide items into short-head, mid-tail, and long-tail groups and study the exposure of these item groups into the top-k recommendation list of users. Experimental validation of eight different recommendation models commonly used for POI recommendation (e.g., contextual, CF) on two publicly available POI recommendation datasets, Gowalla and Yelp, indicate that most well-performing models suffer seriously from the unfairness of popularity bias (provider unfairness). Furthermore, our study shows that most recommendation models cannot satisfy both consumer and producer fairness, indicating a trade-off between these variables possibly due to natural biases in data. We choose the POI recommendation as our test scenario; however, the insights should be trivially extendable on other domains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recommender System is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for users to make decisions on their own choices and interests. Travel and Tourism is one of the important domains in this area. Rapid growth of redundant, heterogeneous data and web has created the importance for Recommender system. Travel Recommender System helps to users or travelers to decide on their choices and preferences on their travel. The work proposes a machine learning approach for a personalized travel recommender system in Malayalam Language, one of the prominent languages used in Southern part of India. The system developed using Collaborative Filtering technique, Malayalam Text processing with the help of Cosine similarity and TF-IDF methods. Data has been taken from the largest Malayalam Travel group in Facebook named “Sanchari”. A customized scraping algorithm also developed to collect relevant and enough information from social media. The RS could suggest most suitable destinations to each of users with the accuracy of 93%, which is fair result as compared with other algorithms on same domain. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Overtourism refers not only to situations in which carrying capacity levels have been exceeded, but also to those in which tourists and residents share negative feelings of discomfort and other emotions, loss of quality of life and unpleasant experiences in their activities of daily life. The growing number of places struggling with the problem of overtourism suggests that brand new approaches are required to minimize the effects of excessive tourism. However, the impacts of overtourism are place-specific and a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate. Many destinations still have a considerable margin to manoeuvre but are nonetheless heading towards increasingly unsustainable levels of tourists per square kilometer. Such regions have time to take some pre-emptive measures based on principles of sustainable development using greener and energy-saving technologies. Over the past few decades, degrowth has arisen as an unorthodox approach based on principles of fairness and social and environmental justice. In certain areas, such as island economies, the economic dynamics remain largely dependent on the tourism sector, which forces the local actors to think and act differently. In this study, we analyze the strategies employed by Madeira to counter the negative effects of oversaturation in a pre-emptive way. The findings of this case study, based on the data at the county level, are enhanced by a panel data analysis of a number of relevant explanatory variables explaining the dispersion of tourists to the rural hinterland. The results suggest that the development of the rural hinterland has proven capable of exerting a progressively positive influence well beyond the borders of the rural hinterland by accommodating a growing share of the increasing numbers of tourists welcomed in the region in the 2002–2019 period, at the expense of the main capital city. This study confirms the importance and potential of the development of the rural hinterland to tackle overtourism in the main tourism areas. In terms of recommendations, it is suggested that local operators and policy-makers must develop efforts to research new ways to adopt energy-saving projects and develop tourisms products that incorporate eco-friendly behaviors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In this digital age, the Internet provides angry consumers an easy means to vent their dissatisfaction. Negative communications shared among consumers exert a strong and destructive influence on hospitality business. The aim of this empirical study is to explore how upscale and luxury hotels in Hong Kong manage negative electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and turn the challenges into opportunities. Findings reveal that hotel managers perceived eWOM not only affects hotel reputation and business revenue, but also makes the management of customer expectation difficult. When developing a personalized management response to address customer feedback, hotel managers face the challenges of limited information about the incident and the complainer. Records of daily operations and documented incidents become good sources of internal information that facilitate effective investigation by hotel managers and fair judgments. Hotel managers also examine the demographic information, travel experiences, and records of the reviews the customers published on eWOM sites to ascertain the kind of customers involved and why these customers experience dissatisfaction. Positive eWOM motivates the management and the team to keep up their good work, whereas negative eWOM is customer-driven learning that drives hotels to identify the problems and make continuous improvement. Practical recommendations are made for eWOM management. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The travel marketing platform of Alibaba serves an indispensable role for hundreds of different travel scenarios from Fliggy, Taobao, Alipay apps, etc. To provide personalized recommendation service for users visiting different scenarios, there are two critical issues to be carefully addressed. First, since the traffic characteristics of different scenarios, e.g., individual data scale or representative topic, are significantly different, it is very challenging to train a unified model to serve all. Second, during the promotion period, the exposure of some specific items will be re-weighted due to manual intervention, resulting in biased logs, which will degrade the ranking model trained using these biased data. In this paper, we propose a novel Scenario-Aware Ranking Network (SAR-Net) to address these issues. SAR-Net harvests the abundant data from different scenarios by learning users' cross-scenario interests via two specific attention modules, which leverage the scenario features and item features to modulate the user behavior features, respectively. Then, taking the encoded features of previous module as input, a scenario-specific linear transformation layer is adopted to further extract scenario-specific features, followed by two groups of debias expert networks, i.e., scenario-specific experts and scenario-shared experts. They output intermediate results independently, which are further fused into the final result by a multi-scenario gating module. In addition, to mitigate the data fairness issue caused by manual intervention, we propose the concept of Fairness Coefficient (FC) to measures the importance of individual sample and use it to reweigh the prediction in the debias expert networks. Experiments on an offline dataset covering over 80 million users and 1.55 million travel items and an online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of our SAR-Net and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. SAR-Net has also been deployed in the online travel marketing platform of Alibaba and is serving hundreds of travel scenarios. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Traveling in a group brings various social and environmental benefits, yet members might have different (and sometime conflicting) preferences. In this study, a tour recommendation framework is proposed that receives a set of must-visit and preferred points of interest from each tourist and forms multi-day tours that cover all must-visit points. Furthermore, the framework attempts to maximize fairness among group members. This ensures all members are motivated to participate in the group tour. While generating the itinerary, the framework also guarantees that a threshold on the commuted distance, time, and monetary budget is met on each day. The benefits of this approach are the maximization of social wellbeing and minimization of energy consumption. The advantages of the proposed framework are confirmed via a test using a Foursquare dataset of two major cities of New York and Tokyo and a user study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Suggesting new venues to be visited by a user in a specific city remains an interesting but challenging problem, partly because of the inherent high sparsity of the data available in location-based social networks (LSBNs). At the same time, in traditional recommender systems, in order to improve their performance in these sparse situations, different techniques have been proposed mainly by augmenting and aggregating the data available in different domains. In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel perspective: we propose two strategies to select a set of candidate cities in order to use their information when performing recommendations for the users in a specific (target) city. In this context, we categorize users into two different groups (tourists and locals) according to their movement patterns and analyze the potential biases in the recommendations received by each of these groups. We provide an experimental comparison of several recommendation algorithms in a temporal split, where we analyze two strategies to select cities and augment the available data: based on the number of interactions and based on the distance with respect to the target city. Our results show that, in general, extending the available data by proximity increases the performance of the majority of the tested recommenders in terms of relevance and coverage, with almost no change in novelty and diversity. We have found that those users belonging to the tourist group tend to obtain better results in terms of relevance. Furthermore, in general, tourists consistently exhibit different performance by some families of recommenders for other evaluation dimensions, evidencing a popularity bias in user behavior and raising potential fairness issues regarding the quality of the received recommendations. We investigate these aspects and provide methods to better understand the problem. We expect these results could provide readers with an overall picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Personalization is one of the key applications in machine learning with widespread usage across e-commerce, entertainment, production, healthcare and many other industries. While various machine learning techniques present novel state-of-the-art advances and super-human performance year-over-year, personalization and recommender-systems applications are often late-adopters of novel solutions due to problem hardness and implementation complexity. This tutorial presents recent advances across the personalization industry and demonstrates their practical applications in real case-studies of world-leading online platforms. Key trends such as deep learning, causality and active exploration with bandits are depicted with real examples and demonstrated alongside their business considerations and implementation challenges. Rising topics like explainability, fairness, natural interfaces and content generation are covered, touching on aspects of both technology and user experience. Our tutorial relies on recent advances in the field and on work conducted at Booking.com, where we implement personalization models on one of the world's leading online travel platform. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - E-commerce websites generate huge volumes of customer review data. In this era of bigdata, recommender systems have played a vital role in suggesting customized recommendations to the users. Recommender systems generally deal with user preferences. Increase in online group activities has fueled the need for group recommender system extremely. A group recommender system recommends one item (or more) to a group of users considered together (with some matching similarity). Group recommender systems are used in various domains like music, movies, travel, etc. Group recommendation uses the preference of their group members in order to recommend the items to a group of users. This chapter explores various group modeling strategies, their implementation methods, and modified variations. Some of the group modeling techniques are additive, least misery, Borda count, Copeland, most pleasure, most respected, mean after threshold, fairness, etc. All the modeling techniques are explained with suitable examples and solved problems. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tourism recommender systems have experienced huge growth over the years, but so far have not satisfactorily considered the process of recommendation as it affects parties other than the end-user. In this paper, we outline approaches and considerations that are of importance when multiple stakeholders' interests are taken into account in a tourism recommendation framework. We also propose a mechanism for quantifying external influences outside the control of the recommendation environment in stakeholder-aware tourism recommendation use-cases. The concepts introduced are evaluated by means of a user study based on a simulated recommender system based on Airbnb listing data, and we find that end-users of a tourist recommender system are sensitive to other stakeholders' interests and largely depend upon the help of the recommender system when dealing with external, non-functional influences.

AB  - The proliferation of smartphones has led to the increased popularity of location-based search and recommendation systems. Online platforms like Google and Yelp allow location-based search in the form of a nearby feature to query for hotels or restaurants in the vicinity. Moreover, hotel booking platforms like Booking[dot]com, Expedia, or Trivago allow travelers searching for accommodations using either their desired location as a search query or near a particular landmark. Since the popularity of different locations in a city varies, certain locations may get more queries than other locations. Thus, the exposure received by different establishments at these locations may be very different from their intrinsic quality as captured in their ratings.Today, many small businesses (shops, hotels, or restaurants) rely on such online platforms for attracting customers. Thus, receiving less exposure than what is expected can be unfavorable for businesses. It could have a negative impact on their revenue and potentially lead to economic starvation or even shutdown. By gathering and analyzing data from three popular platforms, we observe that many top-rated hotels and restaurants get less exposure vis-a-vis their quality, which could be detrimental for them. Following a meritocratic notion, we define and quantify such exposure disparity due to location-based searches on these platforms. We attribute this exposure disparity mainly to two kinds of biases - Popularity Bias and Position Bias. Our experimental evaluation on multiple datasets reveals that although the platforms are doing well in delivering distance-based results, exposure disparity exists for individual businesses and needs to be reduced for business sustainability. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Most recommender systems propose items to individual users. However, in domains such as tourism, people often consume items in groups rather than individually. Different individual preferences in such a group can be difficult to resolve, and often compromises need to be made. Social choice strategies can be used to aggregate the preferences of individuals. We evaluated two explainable modified preference aggregation strategies in a between-subject study (n=200), and compared them with two baseline strategies for groups that are also explainable, in two scenarios: high divergence (group members with different travel preferences) and low divergence (group members with similar travel preferences). Generally, all investigated aggregation strategies performed well in terms of perceived individual and group satisfaction and perceived fairness. The results also indicate that participants were sensitive to a dictator-based strategy, which affected both their individual and group satisfaction negatively (compared to the other strategies). © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement (SE) is considered a best practice in sustainability reporting, as it increases companies' social legitimacy and reputation. Companies have to properly communicate the SE activities, paying attention to the social, cultural, and political factors that affect the perception of stakeholders. This is particularly relevant in the tourism sector, which is a typical multistakeholder context. In the academic literature, few studies have investigated the role of the country-specific determinants of corporate social responsibility, and none of them adopt a cross-country approach. The objective of this paper is to analyze the disclosure of SE, observing the content of nonfinancial reports and company websites of all companies belonging to the Global Reporting Initiative database. Cross-country analysis confirms that European and non-European firms approach SE activities differently. The research offers a contribution to the development and improvement of company relations with stakeholders from a value cocreation perspective, identifying the areas of interest on which firms can work to advance the SE communication process. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - The concept of developing tourism in the region must be based on sustainable development that is supported ecologically, economically, and ethically also socially fair to the community to establish the quality of life by regulating the supply, development, utilization, and maintenance of resources in a sustainable manner. This research is a qualitative exploratory study that emphasizes aspects of enrichment in the field as research strength to create a model. The results of this research are in the form of policy recommendations, as outlined in the new model. The Pentacyclus Concept model consists of three areas, namely the Penta Helix Area; Green Tourism Marketing Area; and the Strategic Sustainable Development Environment with indicators of success involving Penta helix elements, namely: Academic as a concept, Business as an Enabler, Government as a regulator, community as an accelerator and finally the media as a promoter. This model is expected to be applied as a sustainable tourism development planning model that is not only in space local scope but can be used in the national range, especially in some green tourism destinations in Indonesia. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With a vast land area, long history and rich cultural diversity, China is rich in heritage resources and has high potential for heritage tourism development. However, with a relatively short modern history of tourism and a great demand for further development, heritage tourism in China faces many challenges. This chapter analyses the current multistakeholder management structure of heritage tourism in China and discusses its implications for heritage tourism management practices. In addition, with case studies of two Great Wall World Heritage Sites in Beijing, issues concerning community participation in heritage tourism are presented and discussed. The shared tourism use between different types of visitors and residents are analysed with case studies of the Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven World Heritage Sites. © Songshan (Sam) Huang and Ganghua Chen 2020.

AB  - An excessive number of customers often leads to a degradation in service quality. However, the capacity constraints of services are ignored by recommender systems, which may lead to unsatisfactory recommendation. This problem can be solved by limiting the number of users who receive the recommendation for a service, but this may be viewed as unfair. In this paper, we propose a novel metric Top-N Fairness to measure the individual fairness of multi-round recommendations of services with capacity constraints. By considering the fact that users are often only affected by top-ranked items in a recommendation, Top-N Fairness only considers a sub-list consisting of top N services. Based on the metric, we design FAST, a Fairness Assured service recommendation STrategy. FAST adjusts the original recommendation list to provide users with recommendation results that guarantee the long-term fairness of multi-round recommendations. We prove the convergence property of the variance of Top-N Fairness of FAST theoretically. FAST is tested on the Yelp dataset and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that FAST achieves better recommendation fairness while still maintaining high recommendation quality. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Most recommender services help individual users by recommending items within a single category based on the items' overall ratings. However, this may not be sufficient for group activities. For example, a group of friends using an online travel website look for a weekend getaway package (with hotel and restaurant), where the group members have different preferences over the characteristics (e.g., price, service, ambient) of these items. We call items with multiple characteristics as multi-criteria items. The items may come from different categories (e.g., hotel, restaurant). This paper proposes a novel problem of recommending packages of multi-criteria items to a group of users by leveraging users' preferences over categories. As far as we know, our work is the first paper studying this problem. We propose two models to measure the preference of a group to a package. The first model utilizes users' preferences for all the items and all categories, while the second model further leverages the influence of different group members to user preferences. We further introduce a new metric, to measure the fairness of the recommendations to different group members. We present an approach that utilizes co-clustering to incorporate items' characteristics in the calculation of user preferences and creating recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with three real datasets. The experiments show that the second model can find packages that balance better the preferences of all the group members. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Tourist groups exploring a city often face the problem of finding a sequence of points of interest that satisfies all group members. In this work, we present three different configurations of a group recommender system that suggests such trips even when tourists are already traveling: connecting multiple smartphones, sharing a public display, and combining both devices in a distributed user interface approach. We conducted a large user study with real groups to evaluate these configurations. Our results show that public displays are attractive for users who prefer an open discussion of their preferences. However, we have empirical evidence that decisions on group preferences often tend to be unfair for some group members, especially when they do not know each other very well. A distributed recommender system aggregating group members' individual preferences fairly with the option to display selected content on a public display was the most appreciated solution for overcoming this problem. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group toward a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. In addition, we study a special case of the P2G problem, where the recommended items are places and the recommendation should consider the current locations of the users in the group. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.

AB  - Pro-poor tourism seeks to improve opportunities and earnings of the socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This research explored ways in which poor and often marginalized local communities around the Great Zimbabwe National Monument can benefit through pro-poor tourism. The study adopted a mixed methods research framework. Research methods included key informant interviews, a questionnaire survey, participant observations and desktop research. The research findings indicate that local communities are deriving economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits from the tourism economic sub-sector. The benefits accruing to these local communities are derived from selling artefacts, handicrafts, agricultural produce and fruits to tourists as well as often lowly paid wage employment in hotels and lodges. There are also spill-over benefits as improved transport and communication services as the area is linked by an all-weather tarred road from Masvingo City and partial cellular network provision respectively. Moreover, some of the villagers are also involved in fishing in Lake Mutirikwi and its feeder rivers. However, accrual of the stated benefits remains unsatisfactory due to a plethora of factors including poor participation by the local villagers in community-based tourism projects as a result of lack of entrepreneurial skills, technical knowhow, capital and linkages to the mainstream tourism market. The study recommends a multistakeholder approach in building the capacity of local communities in terms of tourism product development and linkages with the mainstream tourism market. This maximization of benefits will enable the local villagers to play a stewardship role towards cultural and biophysical resources found in their area thereby contributing to employment and sustainable tourism development. © 2018 AJHTL /Author/s.

AB  - Tourism today has a problem. It is addicted to growth, which is incompatible with sustainability goals. Despite three decades discussing pathways to sustainable tourism, tourism authorities continue to promote tourism growth despite the ecological and social limits of living on a finite planet. This article argues that tourism must be understood and managed with a wider context of sustainability. Additionally, strategic approaches to transitioning to a sufficiency approach to tourism and leisure is essential if sustainability is to be secured. Recommendations include: transforming the United Nations World Tourism Organization into an Office for Sustainable Mobilities, creating a global Tourism Wealth Fund, fostering diverse approaches to tourism strategies for development and regulating and managing tourism for a better balanced accounting for fairness, ecological limits, human benefit and sustainable futures. The growth fetish is resulting in tourism killing tourism. An approach focused on sustaining tourism is not a sustainable form of tourism send proof to Editor as well as author. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The highest number of tourists’ arrivals recorded in Cameron Highlands was 728, 121 people. In 2014. the number declined by 30% due to landslide events. The main question for this paper is what can be implemented into the tourism strategic planning that may benefit local communities and promote sustainable tourism development in Tanah Rata. Cameron Highlands. The lack of sustainable practice has caused the highlands to degrade and the incentives for agriculture increases in parallel with unequal benefits for locals. There are two key socio economic sustainable tourism concepts which are; community involvement in decision-making and community involvement in tourism benefits sharing being proposed in this paper. Four sets of interview questionnaires were formulated based on 4 components of respondents. Based on the results, this research highlighted that the decision-making process are to be made jointly with the government and local authority in consultation with the community representative. Amongst the recommendations is fair-trade scheme of equity in payment is for locals to benefit off tourism businesses involved in agriculture to protect their working and living environment and gain control over their future. The success of the two concepts requires commitment from all parties. © 2017, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

AB  - It appears that major travel agencies in Taiwan have already put elder people's traveling needs into consideration by including a 'Senior-limited' section on their Web sites. However, the issue will be the practicalness and effectiveness of the design. Based on a recent survey, over 90% prefer to plan trips by themselves, the results showed that the practicalness and effectiveness of the current design are questionable. In this research, we propose an elder-centered trip recommendation method based on crowd intelligence. Our design will take both the opinions from travel agencies and from the crowd into consideration to make a more fair suggestion. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The study’s purpose was to examine and update the research methods and measurement issues associated with assessing the economic impact (EI) of an extended duration, regional tourism event. Specifically examined were the issues with the implementation of EI studies in regard to further testing and re-verifying the methods used in (1) measuring a representative sample from an information-seeking/sharing web site and social media registration and engagement lists; (2) comparing locals and nonlocals within a region using different definition techniques; (3) examining the impact of VFRs within the local markets; and (4) comparing the estimation of purchasing within versus outside an impact area. Recommendations for further analysis and implementation for EI studies and the management of tourism special events are presented. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Recommending packages of items to groups of users has several applications, including recommending vacation packages to groups of tourists, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of package-to-group recommendations, that of fairness. Specifically, when we recommend a package to a group of people, we ask that this recommendation is fair in the sense that every group member is satisfied by a sufficient number of items in the package. We explore two definitions of fairness and show that for either definition the problem of finding the most fair package is NP-hard. We exploit the fact that our problem can be modeled as a coverage problem, and we propose greedy algorithms that find approximate solutions within reasonable time. In addition, we study two extensions of the problem, where we impose category or spatial constraints on the items to be included in the recommended packages. We evaluate the appropriateness of the fairness models and the performance of the proposed algorithms using real data from Yelp, and a user study. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the promotion on the consumer’s perceived value and risk. We are going to study what kind of promotional incentives can gain the favor of consumers and stimulate the consumer’s willingness to buy. Therefore, we use empirical research methods, using questionnaire survey and most of respondents are general public. We have collected about 305 questionnaires. According to the result, having the promotions has a positive effect on consumer’s perceived value, risk and purchase willingness. This study makes recommendations for empirical results: When industries are planning promotions, they should consider increasing consumer’s perceived value and control the perceived risk. They should be with non-monetary promotional activities to increase the repurchase intention of consumers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - As competition among destinations has intensified, researchers have increasingly advocated for a market-oriented approach to destination marketing. Unfortunately, the unique stakeholder structure of the destination marketing environment precludes a direct application of the traditional market orientation paradigm to this domain. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to empirically develop an operational definition of the market orientation construct that can be applied to destination marketing organizations. Based on the tenets of stakeholder theory, this research proposes a multiple-stakeholder view of the marketing concept and develops its attendant operational construct. Referred to herein as a multistakeholder market orientation (MSMO), this construct is proposed and operationalized as reflective of the extent to which a destination marketing organization (DMO) implements the marketing concept across the stakeholder spectrum. The nomological validity of this construct is established by testing the effect of the proposed MSMO construct on DMO performance. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Most research on group recommender systems relies on the assumption that individuals have conicting preferences; in order to generate group recommendations the system should identify a fair way of aggregating these preferences. Both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks have tried to identify the most effective preference aggregation techniques without coming to definite conclusions. In this paper, we propose to approach group recommendation from the group dynamics perspective and analyze the group decision mak- ing process for a particular task (in the travel domain). We observe several individual and group properties and corre- late them to choice satisfaction. Supported by these initial results we therefore advocate for the development of new group recommendation techniques that consider group dy- namics and support the full group decision making process. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group towards a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of revenue management (RM) pricing practices and managers’ perceptions towards this practice in a budget hotel chain and to provide recommendations for improving the adoption of and perception towards this practice. Design/methodology/approach – A single case study method was adopted to conduct an in-depth qualitative research in a hotel organization. In-depth data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observations and documentation. Findings – The research findings indicate that the implementation of revenue management system (RMS): needs to be clearly communicated and made tangible to employees; can impact the profitability of the budget hotel sector and not only mid-scale or luxury sectors; and remains a profit-oriented decision with little consideration for customer outcomes. Research limitations/implications – The findings may not apply to mid-scale or luxury properties, as the results cannot be generalized to other hotel chains in other countries that apply complex pricing structures. Future research might develop multiple case study design to increase the rigor of the research by focusing on themes or patterns uncovered in a single case study. Practical implications – The practical application of the study is twofold: the recommendation to maintain ongoing implementation activities, such as designing operational plans and training programs; the recommendation for a RM pricing strategy that maintains positive price fairness perceptions and results in positive behavioral intentions. Originality/value – This study helps advance our understanding of the characteristics that influence the success of RM implementation in the budget hotel context and provides us with useful insights to design effective dynamic strategies to enhance the implementation process both for the organization and its stakeholders. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The impact on the marine environment of the rapidly growing dive tourism industry in less developed countries is increasingly understood, but little research currently exists on its impact on overall sustainability at host sites. This article applies Social Exchange Theory to assess multistakeholders' perspectives of dive tourism for two Malaysian islands: the Perhentians and Sipadan. We argue that multiple interest groups exist within the sites, with heterogeneous attitudes relating to dive tourism. We found that dive instructors (most knowledgeable and engaged) have the most polarized views and clearly identify links between environment, society, and development. Nondive businesses show greater engagement with economic development impact, but may not link this to environmental preservation. Tourists were surprisingly indifferent-highlighting their lack of loyalty to "place" perse or opportunities for alternative travel choices. © 2012 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

AB  - This paper looks at the challenging enterprise of managing protected areas for sustainable tourism. It notes that during the past 25 years multistakeholder conflicts, complexity and uncertainty have emerged and persisted as important issues requiring managerial responses. These issues reflect substantial paradigmatic shifts in pursuing and understanding sustainability. Governance directs attention to broad participatory approaches, and complex systems theory emphasises transformative changes and an integrative perspective that couples human and natural systems (a social-ecological system). The paper envisions the prospects of adaptive co-management as an alternative approach to protected areas management for sustainable tourism. It also makes the case for an interdisciplinary approach by highlighting important and informative developments outside tourism studies. Adaptive co-management bridges governance and complex systems by bringing together cooperative and adaptive approaches to management. In appraising the potential for adaptive co-management attention is systematically directed to conceptual, technical, ethical and practical dimensions. While adaptive co-management is clearly not a universal answer, experiences and knowledge from natural resource management raise salient prospects for the approach to be insightfully applied to protected areas for sustainable tourism.

AB  - This article advocates a neopragmatic approach to collaborative planning in protected areas characterized by historical conflict among diverse stakeholders. Our example is a multisectoral process initiated to address use and development conflicts in the international tourism destination of Banff National Park, Canada. We show how philosophical presuppositions (essentialism and metaphysical realism) can impede collaboration and exacerbate problems when categories like "environmentalism" and terms like "ecological integrity" are used. Rather than fixing categories and terms up front, a more fluid planning approach is advocated: terms are flexible and meanings emerge through dialogue. Shared descriptions replace contentious categories and terms. © 2002 Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning.

AB  - This paper discusses the competing interests in revenues derived from visitor wildlife tourism based on viewing the mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Mgahinga National Park, Uganda. Financial flows to local communities do reduce their sense of grievance at the park's creation, but do not compensate them for the costs of park creation. Different interests within and outside Uganda compete for wildlife tourism revenue and limit its capacity to fund the direct and indirect costs of gorilla conservation. The creation of multiscale multistakeholder partnerships for conservation built on revenue-sharing is a daunting institutional challenge. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the decision variables used by German travel consumers when making certain travel decisions. Data were gathered in March 2000 at the International Tourism Exchange (ITB) in Berlin. ITB is the leading trade fair for the global tourism industry. The authors investigated Lithuania as a potential travel destination. As a result of this research, the authors recommend that the Lithuanian Tourist Board allocate more resources to informing potential tourists about Lithuania and to the development of a relationship marketing program with past visitors because this segment was found to be more predisposed to visiting Lithuania than the average German. Overall, Germans were found to have favorable tourist consumers' perceptions of Lithuania as a tourist destination and as a safe place to visit. © 2002 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

AB  - This article advocates a neopragmatic approach to collaborative planning in protected areas characterized by historical conflict among diverse stakeholders. Our example is a multisectoral process initiated to address use and development conflicts in the international tourism destination of Banff National Park, Canada. We show how philosophical presup-positions (essentialism and metaphysical realism) can impede collaboration and exacerbate problems when categories like "environmentalist" and terms like "ecological integrity" are used. Rather than fixing categories and terms up front, a more fluid planning approach is advocated; terms are flexible and meanings emerge through dialogue. Shared descriptions replace contentious categories and terms. © 2002 Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning.
